May you find the articles posted here beneficial and encouraging. Connecting with Jesus Christ is the most important thing in life. Why the name Shores of Truth? The ocean is large and deep touching every continent on the earth. Each land mass is different and each shore, where the ocean meets the land, is different and yet the same ocean touches them all. Some shores have sand and different colors of sand, while others are only rocks or cliffs. The ocean waves approach and move differently at each shore as well. God is deep and there is a lot of truth revealed about Him in the Bible.

It is even more difficult to find a modern mystic. In Swami Tripurari we have both: a traditional mystic who can articulate the teachings of an ancient spiritual tradition. A compelling speaker, to hear him and be in his presence is itself a spiritual experience.\nSwami Tripurari met his initiating guru, Srila A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, in the spring of 1972. He relates that he felt as though he had met a long-lost friend, as Srila Prabhupada blessed him with his all-knowing glance. Over the years of service that followed, Srila Prabhupada showered him with affection and repeatedly expressed his appreciation for his selfless service and ability to inspire others. In 1974 Srila Prabhupada instructed him in a widely circulated letter, \u201cSo you organize freely. You are the incarnation of book distribution. Take the leadership and do the needful.\u201d Accordingly, Swami Tripurari has set an example of one who is independently thoughtful and capable of making an insightful literary contribution to the world. In 1975 Swami Tripurari was initiated by Srila Prabhupada into the renounced order of sannyasa.","categories":"Society & Culture | Religion & Spirituality | Spirituality | Philosophy | Hinduism","author":"Dulal Chandra dasa","id":"557562035"}

We talk about how adversity can bring out one's strengths, how acceptance precedes growth, and how curiosity about one's life and the world around them often leads to finding one's greatest joys. A mix of humor, life coaching, and genuine love of people lead to the quirky and fun style of this podcast.","categories":"Health | Society & Culture | Personal Journals | Spirituality | Religion & Spirituality | Self-Help","author":"Paula Jenkins, Life Coach, Blogger, Retreat Leader","id":"1038327569"}

It\u2019s everything! We are a church based on the significant biblical truth that Jesus\u2019 finished His work of redemption on our behalf. Nothing has been left to chance, and nothing has been left undone regarding what Jesus accomplished for everyone who believes. It is finished! This is the essence of The Good News from God to man, and the Good News is better than most have thought. We not only believe in God\u2019s abundant grace and love, but we also seek to apply it in our daily lives. We believe you will see the difference for yourself. So whether you are just beginning to ask questions about God, or are already a believer seeking to sink your roots of faith even deeper, you can find a home here at Grace Church. We see you as unique and valuable because that is how God sees you! He sees YOU\u2026and He loves what He sees.","categories":"Christianity | Religion & Spirituality","author":"Grace Church Orlando","id":"885141434"}

Garry will tell you that his career in radio all began with a dead butterfly. One day he walked out of his house and saw a beautiful dead Monarch butterfly lying on the ground. He scooped up the lifeless harbinger of things to come and sent it to his then favorite disc jockey, Larry Lujack, the biggest jock in Chicago at the time. Larry was always talking about reincarnation and he claimed he was going to come back as a butterfly. In a note accompanying the butterfly Garry said, \"I think I found your dead uncle. Sorry for your loss\". Larry read the note on the air. For Garry it was a \"flashpoint\" moment. Fascinated with radio, he knew what he was destined to do in life when he heard his material on the air. Meier rose to prominence in Chicago as part of one of the most successful number one radio duos in the country, the Steve & Garry Show. The fifteen-year run garnered international publicity, as well as an Emmy for the TV show Greetings From Graceland. Meier also gained renown for his highly successful eight-year run on the Roe & Garry Show. In addition to these accomplishments, Meier has displayed his wit and energy as a solo host and as a feature reporter for WGN-TV's morning show. He loves what he does, carrying all of his inventory in his head and feels that even with all of his success, the best is still yet to come.","categories":"TV & Film | Comedy | News & Politics","author":"Garry Meier","id":"1088025310"}

There is a living, present day, \"I am,\" Word being fulfilled today that makes God real to you. This relationship changes your desires and makes you live a life that's pleasing to Him. The changes comes from the inside out - not will power. As we accept the Word for our day and walk in the Light as He has revealed it, the Lord Jesus becomes manifested in our flesh. We believe in the second coming of Christ, but we also believe that God will repeat the pattern that He has laid out in scripture from His first coming, 2000 years ago. Back then He foretold and sent a forerunner, a prophet called, John the Baptist. The same holds true for the second coming. There is scripture for an end time forerunner, with the spirit of Elijah, to introduce the second coming of Jesus Christ, like the John the Baptist of old. The forerunner is William Branham, and this humble man had a supernaturally vindicated, powerful ministry that God Himself orchestrated. We are in the cycle of the second coming. Don't miss it, like the Pharisees and Sadducees (religious leaders) of old. When the very fulfillment of the Old Testament stood in front of them, they were so spiritually blind that they not only called Him a devil, they wanted to kill Him. The religious leaders of our day are doing the same thing. They're calling a true work of the Lord, Beelzebub, or a work of the Devil. The second coming of the Lord is at hand and the Bible details exactly how it will happen. It describes the conditions of the world when it will happen, and details who will be here as it happens. It also prophetically describes the condition of the Christian church from Jesus' time to the end time and it's all played out perfectly. The Bible is the Word of God. It's True. God is real and He's coming for His elect. It's His plan, He's Sovereign. We're coming to a historic climax. The world, both naturally & politically is falling apart. It's time to surrender our own ideas and turn to Christ.","categories":"Christianity | Religion & Spirituality","author":"Franco Grillo","id":"1126107301"}

At this stage the church had been without a Lead Pastor for years.  After a few months of very quick growth, Ps Jesse and the team believed the Lord was calling us to set ourselves up for ongoing growth and change, and so the church was renamed \"Eternity Church\", and we found a new facility in Des Moines suburb of Clive, IA. This facility was much larger than we needed at the time, but we had seen Gods favor and growth, so in faith we believed God would fill the new building with the broken, the lost, the hurting and the strong. Anyone could find a place where Jesus makes all things new, and worship him together! Restoration is the reason, and restoration is what He does.","categories":"Religion & Spirituality | Christianity","author":"Eternity Church","id":"885614755"}
